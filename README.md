## How to Install

Requires [Lovely Injector](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector), [Steammodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods), and the mod [DeckSkinsLite](https://github.com/Kekulism/DeckSkinsLite)! 

1. Drag the contents of the "skins" folder into the "DeckSkinsLite/skins" folder.
2. Do the same for the images in the "1x" and "2x" folders, copying them into the folder of the same name in the "DeckSkinsLite/assets" folder.
3. That's it! You should have the option for the Guilty Gear Skins for every suit now! :))
